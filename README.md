# Love Cards - For Ruby 💖🌹

This project is an interactive digital letter personalized for **Ruby**.

## ✨ Features and Improvements

### 1. Full Personalization
-   **Heartfelt Message**: Letter rewritten with words of support, affection, and motivation specifically for Ruby.
-   **Custom Photo**: Integration of her photo (`ruby.jpg`) with smart loading and error handling.

### 2. Premium Visual Design ("Glassmorphism")
-   **Photo Container**: New design with gradient borders, a glowing rotating ring, and diffuse shadows.
-   **Buttons**: "Shine" effect on interaction and deep shadows for a modern look.
-   **Mixed Particles**: The background rain now combines:
    -   🌹 Realistic rose petals.
    -   ❤️ Floating hearts.
    -   ✨ Golden sparkles.

### 3. Mobile Optimization (Mobile-First)
-   **Rain Density**: Adjusted to look fuller and more beautiful on small screens without affecting performance.
-   **"Breathing" Effect**: The card has a soft heartbeat animation on mobile to feel alive.
-   **Responsive Design**: Spacing and size adjustments across all elements.

### 4. Robust Music Player
-   **Secure YouTube**: Implementation via secure `iframe` (`youtube.com`).
-   **Anti-Blocking**: Automatic fallback system. If the video fails to play (due to mobile browser restrictions or apps like TikTok/WhatsApp), a direct link appears: "📺 If it doesn't play, click here".

## 🚀 Installation and Usage

1.  Open `index.html` in your browser.
2.  Enjoy the entry animation.
3.  Click "Open my letter" to see the message and listen to the music.
